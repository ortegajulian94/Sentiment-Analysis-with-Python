# Sentiment-Analysis-with-Python

This project performs sentiment analysis on text data using Python and NLTK. Sentiment analysis involves determining the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of a piece of text.

## Overview

Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) task that aims to classify the sentiment of a piece of text. In this project, we use the IMDb Movie Reviews dataset to train a machine learning model to classify movie reviews as positive or negative.

## Steps

1. **Data Collection**: The IMDb Movie Reviews dataset is used for this project. You can collect your own dataset or use existing datasets available online.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the text data by removing noise, such as special characters and stopwords, and converting text to lowercase.

3. **Feature Extraction**: Convert the text data into numerical features that can be used by machine learning algorithms. Common techniques include Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, or word embeddings.

4. **Training a Model**: Train a machine learning model using the preprocessed text data and corresponding sentiment labels. Algorithms like Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or deep learning models can be used.

5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of your model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Techniques like cross-validation ensure robust evaluation.

6. **Deployment**: Optionally, deploy your model as a web application or API using frameworks like Flask or Django.
